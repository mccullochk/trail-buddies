    description: "This province has many natural wonders--the Hoodoos are definitely among the most exotic ones. More than 10,000 years ago, the clay benches along the South Thompson River formed the bottom and shoreline of glacial Lake Thompson. Centuries of erosion have created these intriguing rock formations, referred to as Hoodoos, only a short distance from the center of Kamloops. The valley in which these majestic sandstone structures are located is easily accessible and can be reached in less than an hour. Take your camera, it’s well worth recording this example of Mother Nature’s wonders.",
